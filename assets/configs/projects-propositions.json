The task of this project is to create a responsive web-aaplication (for phones, tablets, and desktops) in which the user can try to guess the randomly rolled number. Game can be stopped in any moment and user should have a possibility to return to this game (state should be recreated). The user should also be able to see the history of the game (what number he guessed and what was the result). If you decided to use IndexDb for caching, then you can also learn a library(idb) that makes interactions with IndexDb much easier.",
